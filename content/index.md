Markdown based web site framework.

MDWeb is painstakingly designed to be as minimalistic as possible while taking less than 5 minutes to setup and less than one minute to add content.

This project was borne out of my frustration with maintaining websites and adding content. I'm a firm believer in the ethos that CMS is an evil that should be rid from this world. I spent years fighting horrific battles with enemies such as Drupal, Wordpress and Joomla. The things I saw during those dark days can not be unseen.

After years of batlle, this weary web development soldier built himself a a tiny oasis. This is MDWeb, I hope you find respite in it.
