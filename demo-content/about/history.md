MDWeb began out of my need for a framework to host a site for my 
personal projects called lapinlabs.com. Over the past four years I went
through the following iterations:

### ~July 2012
Started building a site in Python, Django and Django-CMS. This 
iteration was never completed.

### ~March 2013
Started over again, this time using PHP and Drupal. This iteration was
never completed.

### May 2014
Started over again, this time using PHP and the Pico framework. I 
completed a basic version of this iteration but there were some issues
I found with the Pico framework. Despite the issues I realized that
the project was onto something. I decided to try a Markdown-based
framework of my own.

### Jan 2015
Started over again, this time building my own Markdown framework on
top of Python and Flask. So far so good...

### The Present
That brings us to the present. My projects site is now hosted on MDWeb
(lapinlabs.com)[http://lapinlabs.com] and I consider my journey
complete. I have opensourced the framework and hope others find it
useful.
