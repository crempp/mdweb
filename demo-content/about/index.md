MDWeb is painstakingly designed to be as minimalistic as possible while
taking less than 5 minutes to setup and less than a minute to add
content.

This project was borne out of my frustration with maintaining websites
and adding content. I'm a firm believer in the ethos that CMS is an
evil that should be rid from this world. I spent years fighting
horrific battles with enemies such as Drupal, Wordpress and Joomla.
The things I saw during those dark days can not be unseen.

After years of battle, this weary web developer built himself a tiny
oasis. This is MDWeb, I hope you find respite in it.
